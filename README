Submission Requirements for Assignment 1

After creating the JAR files, I've imported the JAR files into Eclipse again. I've checked that there's no compilation error. I will lose 50% if that's not the case.

-----HOW TO RUN THIS (On Eclipse)----

1.Create a java project

2.Right-Click on the src folder and select import

3.Select Archive File under General folder and click next

4.Click Browse and located the "Team2Assignment" file and click finish

5.Now to add the library, right-click on the java project ->Build Path ->Add External Archives

6.Located the lib folder that contains all the jar files

7.Select all the .jar files and open
    Note:All the jar files can be found at http://developerlife.com/tutorials/wp-content/uploads/geoip_service.zip by downloading the source code
	- This should add all the jar files in Referenced libraries
	
8. open SampleApp.java and run it
